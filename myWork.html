        <p>
          This is my capstone project that focuses on nut production in the Central Valley that highlights the people's concern over water use by the nut industry. Almonds, walnuts, and pistachios are three perennials tree nuts whose global markets have been soaring in the past decades. Farmers and big corporations have been growing these nuts in the CV, where the land is dry, to make huge profits from the soaring markets. However, the main issue is the water shortages and the fact that this massive acreage of land is being converted and expanded to grow these high-water-intensive tree nuts. 
          In growing these trees, lots of groundwater has been overdrawn, which has caused groundwater depletion and further water shortages.
      My study uncovered that nut production has been expanding gradually, suggesting that the nut industry is still favored in central valley agribusiness due to its economic values. 
      Furthermore, the study found that groundwater has been depleting at a dramatic rate, especially since 2014. Finally, the significant correlations (R-square = 0.70) 
      between the acreage increase and the groundwater decrease from 2014 to 2018 have implied that the further increase in acreage could further decrease the groundwater leading to severe water shortages.

        <p>
          Around the United States, law enforcement agents and district attorneys have been increasingly shifting to public nuisance law in 
          an alleged effort to reduce gang violence (Swan et al. 2017). For instance, civil gang injunctions (CGIs) or simply Gang Injunctions (GIs), 
          although not a proven method, have become a tool/protocol in justifying the success of reduced crime and violence in many cities in California, 
          such as Los Angeles, Santa Ana, and Anaheim. According to Muńiz (33),"Gang Injunctions are civil lawsuits against neighborhoods based on the claim
           that gang behavior is a problem for nongang-involved residents" (Muñiz 2015).
          <br><br>
          As a Final Project in my American History class, I visualized the current zoning code, the demographic composition of the neighborhoods, and existing developments in and near the 
          Gang Injunctions areas to argue on Gang Injunctions' roles in the displacement and segregation of poor and racial minorities. Furthermore, it will embed the the discourse 
          on settler colonialism and argue the continuation of its practice in the present day.
